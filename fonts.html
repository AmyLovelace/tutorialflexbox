    <h1>10,000 Days (Wings, Pt 2)
    </h1>
    <h2>canci√≥n de tool</h2>
    <p>We listen to the tales and romanticize
        How we'd follow the path of the hero
        Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
        How we'd rise to the height of our halo
        Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
        Our way into the arms of the savior
        Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
        None of us have actually been there
        Not like you
        Ignorant siblings at the congregation
        Gather around spewing sympathy
        Spare me
        None of them can even hold a candle up to you
        Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
        But enough about the collective Judas
        Who could deny you were the one who illuminated
        Your little piece of the divine
        And this little light of mine
        A gift you passed onto me
        I'm gonna let it shine
        To guide you safely on your way
        Your way home
        Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?
        Without you to guide them all to Zion?
        What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun?
        Other than tremble incessantly?
        High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
        You are the light and the way that they'll only read about
        I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
        Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
        You're going home
        You're the only one who can hold your head up high
        Shake your fist at the gates saying
        "I have come home now
        Fetch me the Spirit, the Son, and the Father
        Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
        It's time now
        My time now
        Give me my
        Give me my wings"
        Give me my
        Give me my
        Give me my
        Give me my
        Give me my
        Give me my wings
        You are the light, the way
        That they will only read about
        Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
        Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
        You were my witness
        My eyes, my evidence
        Judith Marie, unconditional one
        Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
        Difficult to see you in this light
        Please forgive this bold suggestion
        Should you see your maker's face tonight
        Look him in the eye
        Look him in the eye, and tell him
        "I never lived a lie, never took a life
        But surely saved one
        Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home"
